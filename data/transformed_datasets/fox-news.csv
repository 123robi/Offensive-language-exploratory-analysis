But now that it's 2016, all of a sudden it's a problem. Why? Politics. And the awareness that these people exist."

"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,I wonder which of your favorite talking heads just said that on TV.
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,"I agree that people should use the public bathroom that fits their actual gender, but what harm to society is caused by someone being transgender?"
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",1,3,"The ones harmed the most are the children who are taught in government schooling that ""transgenderism"" is a valid description of a true reality. First, the very fact that ""transgenderism"" is not a true reality in itself but a condition of mind makes the claim of validity false...thus being deceptive for the children, youth, adolescents and adults who are deceived by it. Deception about anything critically important in the learning, growth, self-understanding and self-appreciation, and view of the civil society is evil and must be refused and refuted. To confuse children and youth, especially on the issues of their own nature is inexcusable and abusive to them. Because the falsehoods regarding ""transgenderism"" are being foisted on the culture by intention and willing complicity, the evil effects are widespread and become repeated in social media of all kinds.The result for stability of family and civil society is degradation of both."
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,"Seriously, your denial of transgenderism as a ""real thing"" is quite dangerous as is the condemnation of anyone who is struggli g with identity issues because they are born that way or develop differently due to hormones and biology."
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",1,3,"Transgenderism is just that, an ""ism"", meaning it is a condition of mind not based on reality. So when I say ""real thing"" I'm referring to the reality that such a person is confused because they think in their minds they are something which they are not in reality. Condemnation of such confused people isn't appropriate though either, precisely because they are confused and their inner motivations which bring on that confusion are something they don't understand themselves."
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,"""Trangenderism"" is real. Does it mean someone's gender has actually changed? No, but that doesn't make it less real. You mention evil effects. What are they? Be specific, not just something like it's evil or wrong."
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",1,3,"To call some confusion of mind ""real"" distorts the discussion, as I tried to make clear that the confusion phenomena is real, i.e. that the person is really confused. So what is real is in opposition to what the confused person believes is real. When I refer to ""evil"" effects, I'm not using the term generically very often but to indicate a moral form of something that is inherently evil. However, I suspect you are looking for the human consequences that are harmful to the subject (victim) and to families and civil society. Is that the case?"
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,"Either way. Yes, how does it harm the individual and society? And, generically, what makes it inherently evil?"
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,"The harm to the person who is confused about their own sexuality should be obvious, but sadly political correctness has suppressed much of the truth about it. On the face of it, it's inherently harmful for a person to be confused about anything where reality is involved, because the confusion causes them to react to reality erroneously, making decisions that are, at least, not in their best interest and that are, at worst, very harmful to their lives and wellbeing."
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,"How will you go about ""curing"" them? They have tried many different kinds of therapy with them. The only best solution for now is to help them transition. Forcing them to be ""normal"" will have them end up in depression, various problems and possibly suicide."
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,"Also they are not ""confused"" as they are well aware of their own bodies."
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",1,3,"There is a common misconception that one can somehow ""force"" a confused person out of their confusion. That seldom works, although there are some conditions where various forms of coercion may be effective...and may raise ethical concerns.Transgenderism, like all of the other sexual confusions and perversions, is inherently depressive to the individual, with other inner self harmful effects also...sometimes resulting in suicide. These are all very sad effects and consequences...and need core inner remedies not pandering, sheltering or accommodating. These confusions and perversions are inherently mental, not sourced in the physical nature itself...speaking generally and referring to the great majority of cases. The problem with most of psychology is that it categorizes ""mental"" as physical, of the brain, instead of the ""mind"". That's why secular psychology has no answers for these conditions, as permanent correction of the core cause. However, well versed psychologists and counselors who understand the mind as being part of the core spirit nature of the human being, human person, treat the person very differently, with an understanding of volition which dynamically changes the process of treatment and dynamically results in core therapy and lasting benefit, true healing of the person to live normally as they truly are in harmony with their physical self."
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,"Again you have not given any viable solution. The ""spiritual counseling"" have been done many times before. The depression comes from the fact that people like you will not accept them as who they are and instead want to force them to conform to what is your idea of reality."
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",1,3,"The depression doesn't come from outside for these persons, but from their inner confusion about their own nature and value. It can be accentuated by outside influence that is demeaning, of course. But the depression source is internal to the person themselves, and is alleviated when they come to understand some core concepts about their nature as human persons as well as their physical nature. I suppose that what you conceive as ""spiritual counselling"" is simplistic recitation of Scripture and platitudes, along with sessions of prayer, etc. What I'm actually referring to is very deep counseling, working inward from the objective self-concepts of the person as God's created being of immense worth and value, to both God and the rest of humanity. But the subject does not easily acclimate to these concepts when they are so confused. It takes a great deal of patience and explanation on various levels of understanding that fit the subject's own initial perceptions and beliefs, helping them to understand where they are in error in their concepts and understanding...and why their understanding is erroneous. Essential in this process is the understanding imparted to the subject that they can choose to believe differently, and choose to redirect their own thinking patterns, actually modifying their brain structure over time. The resulting symbiosis between purposed thought and changes in the brain result in true long lasting, permanent, healing."
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,Seems like general statements again. What is so obviously wrong or evil about it. What actual harm is being caused by their choices?
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,"""Indeed there are those who are last who will be first, and first who will be last."" - Luke 13:30 Guess who will be last in heaven?"
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,No one?
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,No one as in nobody is answering or no one as in nobody is going to be last in heaven despite what Jesus said?
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,"No one, as in my guess is no one."
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,I will be last if you just need someone to close up shop. Does room service exist in Heavan? I hope it is a fun place and not just a bunch of religious nuts praying and such.
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,"Oh it's going to be a fun place all right. So, as Jesus said earlier in this chapter, "" “Make every effort to enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able to."""
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,"So you think it's moral to discriminate against transgender people when science, medicine and psychology all say their condition is legitimate? On what basis?"
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",1,3,"Here we see a rationale commonly used by those who support these bizarre behaviors and policies. First, the terms ""discriminate"" and ""discrimination"" are elevated in their minds to the level of a religious sanctimony, as though they were ultimate weapons of warfare against those who oppose these foolish notions. The idea is to intimidate the opposition with these terms to make them feel guilty of some wrong or evil, or at least make them feel unaccepted for who they are in their politically incorrect belief. Then these supporters of fallacy use a blatant fallacy to try to further intimidate any opposition...as in this case making the outrageously fallacious claim, ""science, medicine and psychology all say their condition is legitimate"". This is supposed intimidate the realists by putting them on the defensive, as though it was their job to refute the grand fallacy, instead of the promoter of the fallacy's job to defend it. Then, the tactic includes a question, which is supposed to imply that the writer is open minded rather than dogmatic and doctrinaire, which they are. Also the question is usually very open ended so that the answer will not like refute anything the writer has claimed, thus diverting attention from the utter fallacy and attempted intimidation to ""put the monkey"" on the back of the opposition. The way to refute these tactics is to speak the truth, even if it is simply put without a lot of facts and figures and arguments...the simple truth. Of course, one can also engage in presentation of facts, figures and arguments which help other readers/listeners learn the deeper proofs for the truth. So, the truth here is that it is righteous to discriminate between righteousness and evil, right and wrong, good and bad, and tell the truth about it. And the truth is that sexual confusions and perversions are a great harm to their subjects and our civil society if tolerated instead of dealt with properly with the Loving Righteousness of God."
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,"How will it harm our ""civil society""? Be specific, now."
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,Did you not understand the question?
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,"I agree that people should use the public bathroom that fits their actual gender, but what harm to society is caused by someone being transgender?"
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,I think he's stumped on that one.
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,Seems so.
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,"First, the terms ""discriminate"" and ""discrimination"" are elevated in their minds to the level of a religious sanctimony – Freedomscout ""Indeed there are those who are last who will be first, and first who will be last."" - Luke 13:30 ""Do to others as you would have them do to you."" - Luke 6:31 Freedomscout, you need to heed to Jesus' words about how you treat other people."

"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",1,3,"which ""other people?"" that has a hidden meaning and means HOMOSEXUALS. we see that the left faith ISLAM never had to be kind to ""others"" in Orlando did they? it depends a LOT on the religion. we watched while 102 ""others"" got shot in a bar yet we get sued over a cake! that VERY selective morality would make Jesus angry."
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",1,3,"Of all the sick moves Obama has made, this has to be the top! He seems to think that as president, the people MUST sereve HIM, not that he should be serving the PEOPLE. The only people he seems to feel obligated to serve are those without morals, which he apparently feels he is part of! Even though he only has a few months left in his term, the house and senate should be calling themselves back into session and impeaching him! Under Obama and Clinton this country has become an immoral, dirtier than dirt nation! I suggest he send his children to a public school affected by this despotic rule! Just to show us how much he believes it!"
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,"So you think it's moral to discriminate against transgender people when science, medicine and psychology all say their condition is legitimate? On what basis?"
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",1,3,So you think it is fine to protect the rights of immoral people while taking the rights from innocent women to have their privacy?
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,people? Who?
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",1,3,that is who.

"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",1,3,I understand completely who they are. You are the one that has bought into the lie that they were born with some genetic defect. Transgender is a sick perversion.
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,Transgenders are immoral? That's news to me. I personally know two and they're not immoral.
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,Like your morals don't fall into question by supporting this.
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,Why should they?
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",1,3,Simply because people like you are out to change what is considered moral into something that isn't.
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,By whose definition? Yours only?
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,No by the standard that has been around since this country was founded and before.
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,No by the standard that has been around since this country was founded and before. So I guess you think we should still have sla very? I'm not surprised. It's biblical too.
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,Nice tactic to switch the conversation.
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,I'm just identifying exactly where your so called morals are coming from.
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,Not hardly.
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,Oh really? Then where?
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,Your interpretation of the Bible is flawed so making you understand anything from it will never happen until you recognize your need for a savior.
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,So you admit it. Your morality is coming from the bible and not science or medicine. Thank you for making my point.
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,"So his morality is based on what was prevalent in the Middle East about 2000 years ago. Nothing like keeping up to date, eh?"

"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,Yep!
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",1,3,its where YOURS comes from too the Bible is why you push TG and gays its a lot more than a book
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,"Deuteronomy 22:28 If a man happens to meet a virgin who is not pledged to be married and r@pes her and they are discovered, 29 he shall pay her father fifty shekels of silver.

"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",1,3,JEWISH LAWS they don't do that. but you care about the return of slavery via gay marriage

"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,"Where do they come from, then?"
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,Like your morals don't fall into question by getting your info about human se xuality and gender identity from a barbaric ancient middle eastern desert tribe that had no problem with adults marrying children and thought the appropriate way to deal with ra pe was to make the ra pist marry the victim.
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,Or stone the victim.
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",1,3,like Muslims do already
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,Discriminate against them in what way?
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,By telling them they can't use the bathroom or facilities of the gender that they're living as and under medical and mental health guidance to live as...as they have been for decades.
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",1,3,someone use the bathroom of their actual gender is not discrimination. A man who identifies as a woman (or vice versa) does not mean he is a woman.
"Texas, 12 states to ask judge to stall Obama transgender bathroom order",0,-1,Except that that's not their actual gender. They're the gender they're living as.

"ICE program failing to rid US of dangerous illegal immigrants, analysts say",1,-1,"Vaughan cited the case of Sarah Root, who was killed in a car crash in Omaha, Neb., in January after Eswin Mejia slammed his car into hers while he was intoxicated and drag racing. Mejia is an illegal immigrant who arrived into the U.S. as an unaccompanied minor, and who had several previous brushes with the law, said Vaughan. “The local detectives asked ICE five times for a detainer on Eswin Mejia, but ICE said that he was not a priority for enforcement because he had not been convicted of a serious crime,” Vaughan said. “He was released on bail and disappeared, and is now on ICE’s most wanted list. It was a major scandal for ICE.” In another instance, Johnny Josue Sanchez, 21, a Honduran national in the country illegally who had been arrested three times, allegedly killed five homeless people when he set fire to a vacant building in Los Angeles. In this case, Vaughan said the combination of ICE’s and Los Angeles’s disinterest in removing Sanchez after so-called previous “minor” offenses resulted in tragedy. In yet another case, Marilyn Pharis, a 64-year-old Air Force veteran, was brutally raped and bludgeoned to death with a claw hammer on July 24, 2015, in her own home. Victor Aureliano Martinez Ramirez, 29, an illegal immigrant from Mexico who was arrested six times in the previous 15 months, was one of two men charged in the case. Keep in mind that Hillary wants to grant our American Citizenship to 11.6 million illegal aliens with 6.6 million of them being Mexicans! Its called pandering to the Hispanic Voters who support her."

"ICE program failing to rid US of dangerous illegal immigrants, analysts say",0,-1,"Indeed, everywhere one looks into Obama’s background, we find sealed records, scrubbed websites, altered documents, deception and unanswered questions. Can anyone imagine for a second if John McCain or George Bush had blocked access to his school, medical, and birth records? It would have been headlines in their case, but as with everything else concerning Obama, the media has given him a pass on this. Of all these marvels, the latest mystery and probably most perplexing is that of Obama’s social security number. It appears that Obama has multiple identities in term of possessing numerous social security numbers. Orly Taitz, an attorney who has filed numerous suits against Obama regarding his eligibility to serve as president, appears to have been the first to discover this. In her suit, representing a number of military officers who are refusing to serve under an ineligible commander in chief, she hired private investigator Neil Sankey to conduct research on Obama’s prior addresses and Social Society numbers. Using Intelius, Lexis Nexis, Choice Point and other public records, Sankey found around 25 Social Security numbers connected with Obama’s name. However, it may not be as many as 25, since Sankey also searched using closely related names such as: “Barak Obama,” “Batock Obama,” “Barok Obama,” and “Barrack Obama.” There may very well be some Kenyans living in America with the same last name and a similar first name. In any case, I will exclude these records for the purpose of this research and focus only on names spelled exactly like his name. Moreover, we can verify many of the Social Security numbers as valid since they’re connected to addresses at which we know Obama resided. Needless to say, there are also a slew of address and social security numbers connected to addresses in states that Obama has no known connection to. In Obama’s home state, Illinois, Sankey tracked down 16 different addresses for a Barack Obama or a Barack H. Obama, of which all are addresses he was known to have lived at. Two Social Security numbers appear for these addresses, one beginning with 042 and one starting 364. In California, where Obama attended Occidental College, there are six addresses listed for him, all within easy driving distance of the college. However, there are three Social Security numbers connected to these addresses, 537 and two others, each beginning with 999. There are no addresses listed in New York where he attended Columbia University, but there is one listed for him in nearby Jackson, NJ, with a Social Security number beginning with 485."
"ICE program failing to rid US of dangerous illegal immigrants, analysts say",1,-1,He did like millions of Mexicans and other illegals have done. Used a dead person number or made up a number. Some even use their children number if they were born in the U.S. A fake social security card in Phoenix runs about $100
"ICE program failing to rid US of dangerous illegal immigrants, analysts say",0,-1,"713 Hart Senate Office Building In Massachusetts – where Obama attended Harvard Law School – we find three addresses, all using the 042 Social Security number. After Obama was elected to the United States Senate in 2005, he moved into an apartment at 300 Massachusetts Ave NW; the Social Security number attached to that address is the 042 one. Yet, three years later, Obama used a different Social Security number for an address listed as: 713 Hart Senate Office Building. This was the address of his United States Senate office. This Social Security number began with 282 and was verified by the government in 2008. This mystery grows even stranger as other addresses and Social Security numbers for Barack Obama appear in a dozen other states not known to be connected to him. Again, I am excluding those records names not spelled exactly like his name. * Tennessee, one address with a Social Security number beginning with 427 * Colorado, one address, with a Social Security number beginning with 456. * Utah, two addresses, with two Social Security numbers beginning with 901 and 799. * Missouri has one address and one Social Security number beginning with 999. * Florida has two addresses listed for his him, three if you count one listed as “Barry Obama.” One is connected to a Social Security number beginning with 762. * In Georgia there are three addresses listed for him, all with different Social Security numbers: 579, 420, and 423. * In Texas there are four different addresses listed for him, one is connected to Social Security number 675. * There are two addresses listed for Barack Obama in Oregon and one address listed for him in the states of Wisconsin, Michigan, South Carolina, and Pennsylvania. All told, there are 49 addresses and 16 different Social Security numbers listed for a person whose name is spelled “Barack Obama.” In some cases, the middle initial “H” is listed. If you were to expand the search to include closely related names such as: “Barac,” “Barak,” and “Barrack” Obama, you would find more than a dozen additional addresses and Social Security numbers. Finally, the one Social Security number Obama most frequently used, the one beginning with 042, is a number issued in Connecticut sometime during 1976-1977, yet there is no record of Obama ever living or working in Connecticut. Indeed, during this time period Obama would have been 15-16 years old and living in Hawaii at the time. Ann, Stanley and Madelyn Dunham"

"ICE program failing to rid US of dangerous illegal immigrants, analysts say",0,-1,Sanctuary is a function of the Catholic Church. States are not suppose to impose their Religion over the citizens of the US. The people under Sanctuary are suppose to be housed and remain on Church Grounds. At the expense of the Church.

Obama and his administration has turned their backs on the American people and America! Obama is quick to point our how many new jobs were created in America but ; he never points out how many were lost, how many of the jobs filled were filled with immigrant workers (his own Labor Department says 3 out of four jobs in America is being taken by immigrants (legal and illegal) or how many men and women who at one time had jobs have run out of unemployment benefits, can not get work and are no longer counted in the ""Official"" Unemployment numbers. He does not point out the massive, huge, and growing national debt that the nation has grown under his administration. Could it be Obama's endorsement of Hillary Clinton was done so history will have someone else to show as the worst president in our history?

Then maybe you can be proud for the second time in your life of America. January 2017 can't come soon enough, bon voyage baby!"

Navy names ship after gay rights advocate Harvey Milk,1,2,I am truly scared of this country now. What have we become? I am not doubting this person may be seen as a person to be recognized for his contribution in history but to name a US Navel Ship this is insane. This country would rather name a ship after a gay right activist then a person of the military maybe a person who died defended America. I am sorry but this is just wrong. It is not the place for reconnection. I don't have an issue with gay's as my grandson is gay but I refuse for them to have more clout then everyone else. A person who is gay should not define them. I think it is respectful to recognize that many have differences but not to award these differences as a power tool. Maybe they should name a ship after my husband who spent 7 1/2 years in the US Navy from 1960-1967.
Navy names ship after gay rights advocate Harvey Milk,0,-1,How does naming a ship after him give gays more clout as you say? The navy decided to name this class of ship after people making significant contributions to civil and human rights. Milk did that for the gay community. There are many other classes of ships named after military personnel.

Confederate flag debate: Protecting hatred preserves freedom,0,-1,"Judge Napolitano, I must correct you on a talking point I just watched you state on Fox Extra. Your point that South Carolina should remove the Confederate Flag from the State House is wrong, and it surprises me that you failed to do the proper research. The state legislature removed the Confederate Flag from the State House on 1 July 2000. It was then placed BEHIND the Confederate War Memorial on State House grounds to honor the troops from SC who fought for the Confederacy, right where it belongs. In the future, PLEASE do your research before spouting off like a liberal."
Confederate flag debate: Protecting hatred preserves freedom,0,-1,"The flag means different things to different people, especially people that do not live in the south and do not understand southerners or their heritage. I have no hate for any race, I try to avoid ticking off others by using racial comments in public just as I try to avoid cussing at the office. But don't understand how 13% of the population can tell the rest of us that we have to believe what they believe, and we cannot honor our ancestors who fought the North in the civil war by flying a flag on our private residence if we choose to. Two weeks ago I started flying both the American flag as well as the confederate battle flag daily. Don't like it, make your opinions known from the street, touch my flag and I'll defend my possessions as its attached to my house. Since I started flying it, 5 other neighbors have started flying theirs as well. All of which used to fly the American flag on flag day, holidays, and anytime it felt right to do so, now they all fly the Rebel flag(battle flag) as we feel we are under attack, not from minorities who live in the south, but once again from activists from the North, forcing their opinions and rules and regulations on us where they have no right to do so. I am rebelling against that in the easiest way I can, by flying a flag that I have displayed on my first car for 40 years, and flying the flag of my College, and the confederacy...regardless if it lost a war or not. The North cannot abolish southern values or heritage, even if they want to protest our government buildings, try it in the suburbs and see what type of response you get."

Confederate flag debate: Protecting hatred preserves freedom,0,-1,The Confederate Battle Flag to me represents to me the willingness to stand up to an obsessive Federal Government that enforces its will through violent force. No state ever surrendered its Sovereignty under the Unites States Constitution. During the Philadelphia debates that was one of the main issues. The states ONLY surrendered 18 power that the Federal Government of the newly formed REPUBLIC would have the power to enforce. Also didn't South Carolina have the oldest Constitution that predates the US Constitution. Now that basically means that the Confederate Battle Flag represents standing up to tyranny and oppression of a tyrannical government. The war for independence from British Oppression was fought for the same reason as the civil war. The civil war was not fought over slavery...it was fought over the belief that the federal government did not have the authority to dictate to the states...(minus a constitutional admin.) Slavery was wrong and terrible blight on our past. The Confederate Battle Flag is part of our history and our southern heritage.
Confederate flag debate: Protecting hatred preserves freedom,0,-1,"The Federal Government violates the constitution left and right. Read the Judge's piece, ""Imagine America without the Constitution"" to see just a few clear examples. Our nation was intended to be one of numerous separate sovereign States, yielded limited authority to a central government for the purpose of patrolling the coasts for piracy, minting currency, and other things that a Federal government would be able to do more efficiently than all the States separately. Lincoln would undoubtedly role over in his grave if he would have seen how the Federal Government would have used the Civil War to strip states of their rights and powers… The Federal government just votes itself more power year after year."

Maybe we should be more concerned with the atrocities done to the natives of America. Maybe they should be slightly more offended by the flag flying over the White House.

Deliberately infected blankets with smallpox given to old men, women, children, in order to wage germ warfare against them. Deliberate bombing of civilian centers in Germany and Japan instead of only industrial targets. Thousands wiped out in a fiery holocaust in just 2 days in Hiroshima and Nagasaki using atomic weapons.

Confederate flag debate: Protecting hatred preserves freedom,0,-1,"barker @flrlegal The ""whole purpose"" was not slavery, and the vast majority of those who fought for the South did not own slaves. Many were ambivalent with respect to it. But, what drove the conflict most was the idea that the States were not subservient to the United States, and had a contractual right to withdraw from it. New York was the first to test this during the first ""civil war"" of 1812, when NY's legislature drafted articles of succession. Had the Brits decided to back off after burning D.C., NY and other Eastern States may have tried to leave the Union. The Southern States might have said ""good riddance"". The issue of the Confederacy certainly contained the ongoing issue of slavery, but its primary issue was ""States rights"", a battle that continues to this day."

Confederate flag debate: Protecting hatred preserves freedom,0,-1,I find it funny that people are talking about freedom of speech. Nobody said you can't fly a flag at home. They are just saying the state government shouldn't do it.
Confederate flag debate: Protecting hatred preserves freedom,0,-1,So what are your thoughts on affirmative action?

Why on Earth should we keep perpetuating this??
Confederate flag debate: Protecting hatred preserves freedom,0,-1,Good point.

Confederate flag debate: Protecting hatred preserves freedom,0,-1,Another good point.
Confederate flag debate: Protecting hatred preserves freedom,0,-1,Enemy state? Tells me you not only do not know your country's history you also are not up on why the states felt that they could secede.

Confederate flag debate: Protecting hatred preserves freedom,0,-1,I agree. Flying a flag that symbolizes racism perpetuates racism. Time to take it down.
Confederate flag debate: Protecting hatred preserves freedom,0,-1,"what flag is that? confederate flag never internationally promoted racism, slavery maybe but it also represents southern patriotism..."
Confederate flag debate: Protecting hatred preserves freedom,0,-1,"Yeah, you're right. The flag representing a people defending slavery in no way represents any racism. If you want to demonstrate your American patriotism in the south, FLY AN AMERICAN FLAG! Not the flag of an enemy state."
Confederate flag debate: Protecting hatred preserves freedom,0,-1,"I am very proud of the America Flag. Maybe you need to learn some more about what occurred under this flag since the first day it was raised. You really should stop being so melodramatic, not becoming at all."
Confederate flag debate: Protecting hatred preserves freedom,0,-1,"Really? ""Smudge in history."" Kidnapping thousands and enslaving them is not a ""smudge."" I am southern and I have pride without ever having touched that racist flag. It is extremely hateful and should have been retired (well, it was before the civil rights movement) years ago."
Confederate flag debate: Protecting hatred preserves freedom,0,-1,I'm not understanding this kidnapping point. Be real. Other countries took by force their own people and sold them for a coin. Stop attempting to portray this country as being the only one that participated in this evil trade.
Confederate flag debate: Protecting hatred preserves freedom,1,-1,"Yes, there are LOTS of countries that have been and are far worse. There are still lots of slaves in the ME and Africa."
Confederate flag debate: Protecting hatred preserves freedom,1,-1,"See you don't have a clue, the grandmother was nabbed by her own people and sold to slave traders(not from America), the best were sold in S America, the scag was sold in America."
Confederate flag debate: Protecting hatred preserves freedom,0,-1,It's amazing to me that you all think the fact that some blacks owned slaves somehow makes it all ok. By the way; you were the last to know.
Confederate flag debate: Protecting hatred preserves freedom,0,-1,"It is a fact that many blacks owned many slaves. That does not make it okay, but neither does it make white ownership any worse. There are still many blacks owning slaves today, just not here."
Confederate flag debate: Protecting hatred preserves freedom,0,-1,Your lack of knowledge is astounding.
Confederate flag debate: Protecting hatred preserves freedom,0,-1,Kidnapped? How about that flag where the same grandmother could be lynched or kept from ordering and eating a hamburger next to a white person? Where does this end with removing of all things offensive?
Confederate flag debate: Protecting hatred preserves freedom,0,-1,"Liberals want to remove EVERYTHING that THEY do not agree with, including the Constitution."
Confederate flag debate: Protecting hatred preserves freedom,0,-1,"Did you miss the point of the article? This isn't about what we ""should"" do. It is about unlawfully restricting that which we have a right to do."

Same for the Bear issues, Over Development destroys the Bears natural habitat so they have to search for food more and farther, so its mans doing; just Re-Locate them to the Rockies perhaps, that would not require the Bears killed,who are only looking for food most all the times. Too, Disney should have 2 barriers between any dangerous animal or creature and the public. Even a good parent can be caught unawares. Its just human nature to not always be 100% on guard."
